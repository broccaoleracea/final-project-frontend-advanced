This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Create a copy of `.env.example` and create your own environment variable.

For now, you only need to put the base url in there with plans for more in the future.
After cloning the repository, don't forget to run `npm install` to get the required dependencies.

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
